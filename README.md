RMB - ReMove Backup
===================

Do you use **Gedit**?
Have you enabled `auto save` option? (You should, if you haven't!)
Then you must be sick of those Backup files (those ending with a '~'), because they are created automatically by Gedit but are never removed automatically.

RMB to the rescue!
------------------
`RMB` or `ReMove Backup` is a small `python` script that automates finding and removal of Gedit's backup files, so that you need not to walk through each directory to hunt down those unnecessary files manually. ;)
Yeah, I know, It will save your time! :)

How to Run?
-----------
It's very simple to run.
> Fire up `Terminal`
> Type `python rmb.py`
> Done! :)

Make it easy
------------
Convert the `rmb.py` to an executable to make it easy and fast to run it next time.
> Fire up `Terminal`
> Type `chmod +x rmb.py`
> Now simply hit `./rmb.py` whenever you want to run it.
> Done!
